# RPCpp
Little library for C++ that allows to perform Remote Procedure Calls from client to server(s) in a convenient way.<br>
The library is currently in progress.<br>
Now it supports a few simple features:
 - Registering functions, types (classes) and their methods on server
 - Remote calls to functions
 - Creation of remote objects
 - Remote calls to methods of specific remote objects

RPCpp requires modern compiler supporting features of C++20.
